Sentiment classification in TensorFlow on Twitter data, utilizing NLP techniques like Tokenizer and Word Embeddings to preprocess the data, and then create a RNN model with keras to classify the tweets.
Accuracy is average, due to the smaller dataset, and that could be improved by optimizing hyperparameters, but the core of the project is pretty much done.
